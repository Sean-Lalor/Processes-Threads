Made a slight change to how the data is added basically it adds the file
in each of the .c files so no need for any extra effort.


gcc <filename.c> -o <filename> -std=c99 -lpthread -Wall -Werror -lm  -DM_PI=3.14159265358979323846

followed by
./process
./serial
./thread
./processThread

and they should load the file directly into the system with no extra input.
